"""Who started at quarterback, and whether he took a snap, from the play text.

`PLAY_SCHEMA` carries no player fields at all -- team ids, drive bookkeeping
and a free-text description -- so the only place a quarterback's name appears
is the sentence ESPN writes for a play. Two things are read out of it:

- **who started**: the passer who threw a team's early attempts in a game.
- **who took a snap**: everyone credited with a pass or a rush.

The second is what makes an availability flag possible. If the team's
starter records no pass and no rush in a game, he did not play. Who the
starter is -- and when a man who has been covering for him becomes the
starter instead -- is for a caller that sees the season in order to decide:
`say_youll_remember_me.plays` counts starts from it, and cassandra's
quarterback-availability index decides who was missing.

## Four formats

ncaafb play text arrives in three shapes, and all of them have to be read or
a quarterback looks absent when he was only described differently:

    Taylen Green pass complete to O'Mega Blake for 16 yds
    (05:55) Shotgun Nussmeier,Garrett pass incomplete deep left to Hilton Jr.,Chris
    (15:00) No Huddle-Shotgun #7 K.Jackson pass complete short left to #3 C.Brown
    (Shotgun) D.Gabriel pass short middle to D.Njoku to CLV 47 for 12 yards

Which one dominates changes by season, which is the trap. The first covers
almost all of 2025 and the third almost none of it -- and in 2026 the third
is 20,387 of 22,692 plays in a single week. A parser validated on one week
of one season and shipped is a parser that silently stops working, and this
one did: before the `#7 K.Jackson` shape was handled, the 2026 index was
empty and the feature did nothing at all for the season being played.

The fourth is the NFL feed, and it is the odd one: a completion carries no
word for itself at all, and a carry is `up the middle` rather than any kind
of "rush". Handled here because `QB_LEAGUES` covers nfl, and an index built
for a league whose text nobody parsed is a parameter that searches nothing.

They write names three ways -- `First Last`, `Last,First`, `F.Last` -- so
nothing matches across them without normalizing, hence `name_key`, which
reduces all of them to a last name and a first initial.

A name in the `F.Last` formats can run past one token -- `D.Williams Jr.`,
`M.Van Buren Jr.`, `C.Del Rio-Wilson`, `K.Ah Yat`, `A.St. Louis` -- so the
patterns are anchored on the verb, not on a space after the surname. The
first cut of this stopped at the space, and the cost was not "an extra key":
those quarterbacks matched nothing at all, their teams' starter became
whichever receiver threw one trick-play pass, and fifteen teams in 2025 --
Washington, LSU, James Madison, Marshall among them -- read as missing a
quarterback every week from the point that format took over.

The multi-word surname is still the soft spot across formats. `name_key`
folds a run of surname particles ("Van", "Del", "Ah", "St.") into the
surname so "Michael Van Buren Jr.", "Van Buren Jr.,Michael" and "M.Van
Buren Jr." agree; a two-word first name it cannot tell from a two-word
surname, and "Eddie Lee Marburger" and "E.Marburger" still differ. That
only bites at a boundary between formats, which is a week or two a season.

## Who started

The starter is not the busiest passer. A quarterback hurt in the first
quarter throws six passes and his backup throws thirty, and reading the
backup as the starter turns the next week's flag inside out: the injured
man's absence is expected, and his return reads as the backup going
missing. So attempts are weighted by when they happened -- each one counts
`STARTER_DECAY` of the one before it -- which makes the first few decisive
without being a hard rule. At 0.75 a man who threw the first three passes
outweighs everyone who threw after him; a man who threw only the first two
does not. `share` still reports the plain attempt fraction, so an early
injury shows up as a starter with a small share rather than being hidden.

A kneel-down is deliberately not a snap here. It is neither a pass nor a
rush in the box score, which is the definition this is built to, and a
quarterback who came back on to kneel out a half is not evidence that he
was available.
